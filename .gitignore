# TRACEABILITY MATRIX
Library Book Management System

This document maintains traceability between user stories, implementation,
unit tests, sprints, and Git releases. It ensures that all requirements
are properly implemented, tested, and delivered following Agile practices.

| US-03         | As a user, I want to borrow an available book            | borrow_book(book_id)                   | test_borrow_available_book           | Sprint-2 | v0.2    |
| US-04         | As a user, I should not borrow an already borrowed book  | borrow_book() error handling           | test_borrow_unavailable_book_error   | Sprint-2 | v0.2    |
| US-05         | As a user, I want to return a borrowed book              | return_book(book_id)                   | test_return_book_updates_status      | Sprint-2 | v0.2    |
| US-06         | As a librarian, I want to generate a library report      | generate_report()                      | test_report_contains_header          | Sprint-3 | v0.3    |
| US-07         | As a librarian, I want to see all book entries in report | generate_report()                      | test_report_contains_book_entry      | Sprint-3 | v0.3    |

## Notes
- Each user story is implemented in a specific sprint.
- No sprint was merged into the main branch without passing unit tests.
- Git tags v0.1, v0.2, and v0.3 represent completed sprint deliveries.
